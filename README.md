# DCA Portfolio
The objective is to have a script that runs 24/7 dollar cost averaging your fiat to crypto investment portfolio for you.

## Roadmap

* Basic script running to buy BTC daily with fiat balance, essentially replicating the functionality of the script by @levelsio. Initial support for Cointree.
* Support for other cryptos.
* Support for Bitstamp.
* Ability to specify portfolio percentage split between multiple cryptos.
* Implement API for historical price data.
* Some degree of intelligence to attempt to select the lowest day and hour to buy based on historical data. This wonâ€™t be 100% accurate, but should still be statistically better than blind scheduled buying.
* Initial basic web interface for viewing transaction history and performance.
* Integration for Bitcoin.tax
* Support for other currency pairs, such as dollar cost averaging altcoins from Bitcoin balance.
* Support for other exchanges without fiat trading, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, etc.
* Support for fiat deposits where possible.
* Offer this as a web service? Fully encrypted accounts to ensure privacy?
